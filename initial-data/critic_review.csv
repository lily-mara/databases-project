IGN,http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/10/brink-review,6.5,"An online shooter needs variety, depth, and addictiveness to succeed over the long term. Brink might find a niche with some hardcore fans, but it isn't for everyone. The PC version feels more complete than its console counterpart, but my qualms over content remain the same. Brink has heart, but the overall package is lacking.",1
GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/civilizationv/review.html/,9,Excellent tactical battles and a slick interface make the latest Civilization another wonderful addition to a classic franchise.,2
CPUGamer,http://www.2404.org/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=73,10,"Nothing less than a revolution in the gaming industry that will keep gamers busy for years to come, just as the original did.",3
Polygon,http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/4/11265022/dark-souls-3-review-from-software-ps4-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-windows,7,"In so many important ways — its world design, its pacing, the technology powering it — Dark Souls 3 falls short of the mark. Do you play for the joy and stress of exploring dangerous, intricately crafted places full of hidden elements and endless side paths? Then I suspect you'll join me in being a little let down with the direction this sequel has gone in.",4
The Digital Fix,http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/2684/farming-simulator-2015.html,7,"For all its flaws, Farming Simulator 2015 is the latest, best entry in an exceedingly niche genre, a reasonable improvement on the last entry, and perhaps a change of scenery if you’re sick of the sight of alien spaceships and chest-high walls.",5
Game Informer,http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal-2/1163550p1.html,10,The game's quality stays consistently outstanding throughout; there isn't a minute of filler content to be found anywhere in single-player or co-op.,6
GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/dishonored/reviews/dishonored-review-6397799/,9,"It's a rare game that feels so compulsively replayable, but Dishonored is such a game. The compelling abilities, the bold artistic design, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice--these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the truly remarkable games of this year.",7
GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/game_reviews/the-walking-dead-video-game-season-1-review,10,"Overall this game was a unique experience that is not your everyday type of game, but is worth playing and I would suggest this game to almost anyone. It is a game that simply tells a beautiful and tragic story. It sucks you in emotionally and does not let go.",8
Eurogamer,http://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142614-assetto-corsa-orgoglio-nazionale.html,9,"Assetto Corsa is a wonderful racing simulator, inheriting the technical proficiency of Simbin’s GTR 2 and rFactor modding attitude. And bringing them both to a new level.",9
Eurogamer,http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-16-dota-2-review,9,"All of which makes Dota 2 an absurd video game to try to recommend. Being the largest and most immediately open MOBA, with Valve showcasing its talent for rewarding and fostering a community, it demands and offers more than literally any game I can think of. It's almost more comparable to basketball than most commercial games. Something utterly opaque bearing no endgame, but that could happily fill every waking second of your life.",10
